Take aways from my first website (using html,css)

1.you don't need to set width for every dropdownlist just set a max-height , width and max-width
max-width;
width;
max-height;

2.If you don't want you grid layout to overlap other content like in dropdown on hover set it's position to absolute.
position:absolute;

3.IMP IMP IMP for responsiveness use Grids
 and values in rem instead of px.
