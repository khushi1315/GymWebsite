# ðŸŒŸMy First Web Project â€“ A Journey of Learning! ðŸŒŸ

## I built a gym website to apply my learnings practically.
This is first website made by me using html and css in my web development journery.I owe huge thanks to my seniors who organized mentorship programs for different tech stack including web development.It is possible for me to be consistent due to deadlines of learning each topics.I also want to appriciate myself for developing the website while learning new concepts and it took around 3-4 days to complete my first website with valuable takeaways for future projects.
